# Talos Sentinel: Multi-Modal Autonomous Surveillance via Sensor Fusion & Computer Vision
This project was developed as a Final Year Project (FYP) for the completion of a **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** at **Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur**.

**Talos Sentinel** transitions traditional surveillance from passive recording to active hazard response by deploying a locally optimized **YOLOv8** model on a **Raspberry Pi 5** . To eliminate the high false-positive rates typical of vision-only systems, this visual intelligence is mathematically fused with a hardware sensor array—including an **AMG8833 thermal camera**, **MQ-135 gas sensor**, and **Flame IR sensor**—to detect fire, smoke, and gas leaks in real-time.

Built with a "Privacy-First" philosophy, the entire architecture operates at the **Edge**, ensuring zero reliance on third-party cloud infrastructure or external internet connectivity.

## Features:
### 1. Core Intelligence & Processing
* **Edge-Based AI Inference:** Utilizes a custom-trained YOLOv8 model optimized via the **NCNN framework** to detect fire and smoke locally on a Raspberry Pi 5 without cloud dependency.
* **Mathematical Fusion Engine:** A decoupled background loop that calculates a normalized **Risk Score** by cross-referencing AI vision data with physical sensor telemetry to reduce false positives.
* **Thermal Rate of Rise (RoR) Calculation:** Monitors how fast temperature spikes per second rather than waiting for an absolute heat threshold, allowing for faster ```Flash Fire``` detection.
* **State-Driven Alert Lifecycle Manager:** Transitions threats through strict **NEW**, **ACTIVE**, and **RESOLVED** phases using ```persistence windowing``` to verify hazards over time.

### 2. Hardware & Connectivity
* **Multi-Modal Sensor Array:** Integrates an **AMG8833** thermal camera, **MQ-135** gas/smoke sensor, and **Flame IR** sensor for secondary hardware validation of visual threats.
* **Hardwired Serial USB Bridge:** Connects the ESP32 sensor manager to the Raspberry Pi 5 via USB to eliminate wireless latency or interference during an emergency.
* **Standalone Wireless Access Point (WAP):** The system broadcasts its own encrypted ad-hoc network, ensuring it remains operational and accessible even if municipal internet infrastructure fails.

### 3. Software & Security
* **Asynchronous Vision Pipeline:** Employs Python's multiprocessing and shared memory to isolate heavy AI math from the web server, maintaining a fluid 25 to 30 FPS camera feed.
* **Token-Based Authentication (JWT):** Secures all REST APIs, evidence snapshots, and live video streams using **JSON Web Tokens** and **bcrypt** password hashing.
    <div align="center">

    </div>
* **Dual SQLite Database Architecture:** Uses separate, lightweight databases for secure user authentication (**auth.db**) and persistent, high-efficiency event logging (**alerts.db**).

    </div>
* **Containerized Microservices:** The entire software stack is deployed via **Docker**, ensuring environment isolation and easy portability across different hardware.

### 4. User Interface & Monitoring
* **Real-Time React Web Dashboard:** A high-contrast dark-mode interface featuring dynamic thermal grid color-mapping, live MJPEG streaming, and interactive alert history.

* **Hybrid Android Mobile Application:** A Capacitor-powered application that provides mobile monitoring, remote push notifications, and evidence retrieval over the local network.
* **Low-Latency Evidence Capture:** Automatically captures high-fidelity visual snapshots with bounding box overlays the moment an alert becomes ```ACTIVE``` for later audit.
* **Client-Side CSV Export:** Allows administrators to generate and download structured incident reports directly from the browser for record-keeping.

## Installation & Deployment Guide:
This guide details the steps required to set up this system on a Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32.

### 1. Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:
* Python 3.12+
* Node.js (v24 or newer)
* Arduino IDE (for ESP32 flashing)
* Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

### 2. Hardware Setup
1. **Sensor Array:** Wire the AMG8833, MQ-135, and Flame IR sensors to the ESP32 according to the Pinout Mapping & Calibration Guide in ```./repo_resources/sensor_calibration_and_mapout.md```.
2. **Connection:** Connect the ESP32 and USB Camera to the Raspberry Pi 5 via USB ports .
3. **Networking:** Power on the Pi. It is configured to broadcast an ad-hoc network: ```AI_Surveillance_Edge```.

### 3. Microcontroller Firmware
1. Open ```sensors/AMG_MQ_IR/AMG_MQ_IR.ino``` in the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Install libraries: ```Adafruit_AMG88xx``` and ```Wire```.
3. Select your ESP32 board and click **Upload**.

### 4. Backend & AI Engine Setup
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/umairyousif239/AI-Surveillance-System.git
cd AI-Surveillance-System

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (FastAPI, OpenCV, NCNN)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API server
uvicorn backend.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 5. Frontend Dashboard Setup
In a new terminal on the Pi (It is possible to run the frontend alongside the backend. However, it is highly recommended to host it on a different machine to mitigate the processing on the Pi 5): 
```
cd fire-dashboard
npm install

# Set the target IP to the Pi's Access Point IP
echo "VITE_IP_ADDR=10.42.0.1" > .env

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Docker Deployment (Alternative)
```
# Ensure you are in the root directory
docker-compose up --build -d
```
Note: Docker automatically handles hardware passthrough for ```/dev/video0``` and the ESP32 serial bridge.

### Mobile App (Android)
1. Sync the web assets: ```npx cap sync android```.
2. Open the ```android``` folder in **Android Studio**.
3. Connect your phone (with USB Debugging enabled) and click **Run** to flash the APK .
